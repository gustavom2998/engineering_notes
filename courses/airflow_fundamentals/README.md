# Apache Airflow Fundamentals

Notes are based of the course [Apache Airflow Fundamentals by Astronomer Foundation](https://academy.astronomer.io/astronomer-certification-apache-airflow-fundamentals-preparation). 

## Course Notes

The course is a good introduction to Airflow and covers the basics of Airflow. The course is a good starting point for anyone who wants to learn Airflow. It covers the basic such as from what Airflow is and how it can be used - and the different components within Airflow.

## Personal Notes

I took the course in 2021 and the course is based on Airflow 2.0.0. I started it in September 2021 and took about 10 days to get through it. I took the course when we were attempting to use Airflow to replace AWS Step functions. I had no idea about airflow or how it worked, and the course was a great introduction. It helped me get Airflow up and running locally, and gave me a sandbox environment were I could freely experiment with Airflow. It gave me a basic understand and after looking into the AWS documentation, we managed to build DAGs that could be used to replace the AWS Step functions we had previously built. It also solved many of the problems we were having such as problems with concunrrency, logging, and monitoring. The course was a good introduction, but I'd need a better reference for building more complex pipelines. Also, this material isn't updated to cover the latest version of Airflow.
