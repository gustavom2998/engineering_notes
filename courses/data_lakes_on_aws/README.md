## Personal Notes

I started this course on my first week as an intern in May 2021 and took about 5 days to complete it. The notes can be biased since it didn't have ~~much~~ any experience at the time and the course is prepared by the Cloud Provider. It did help me understand the fundamentals of what a data lake should be. I spent around 6 months applying the concepts that I learned in this course and it was a great starting point. Many pain points that aren't addressed in this course and I'll try to jot them down as I transcribe the notes from the course.
