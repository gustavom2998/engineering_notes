# Engineering Notes

Personal repository for storing notes for books, courses and articles related to software and data engineering in general. Planning to add sample scripts, code snippets and other useful stuff based on the reading materials. I plan to add a to-do list for each book, course or article and keep it updated since I always find cool stuff to read but end up forgetting about it very quickly. Hopefully, I'll be able to cover my road to becoming a better engineer - and maybe help others along the way.
