    "# Fact table techniques: Measure categories\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be analyzing multiple fact table techniques that can be applied to all fact tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fact table structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we recap the basics of a fact table:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Should contain numeric measures produced by operational events in the real world.\n",
    "- A row should correspond to an event and vice-versa.\n",
    "- Should always contain foreign keys for each associated dimension, as well as optional degenerate dimension keys for dates and timestamps.\n",
    "- Should be the primary target of computations and dynamic aggregations for queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Categorizing numerical measures\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have stated previously, fact tables should contain numerical measures. These measures can be categorized into three types:\n",
    "1. **Aditive**: Measures that can be summed across any of the dimensions associated with the fact table.\n",
    "2. **Semi-aditive**: Can be summed across some dimensions but not others. For example, account balances can be summed other dimensions, but you can't sum along time since it's a measure of a point in time.\n",
    "4. **Non-aditive**: Measures that can't be summed across any dimension. For example, ratios and percentages - If you sum them they don't make sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since non-aditive facts don't add much value to the fact table, and may be used to generate misleading metrics, the question of whether or not to store them physically arises. They're useful for showing the actual value, and for filtering, but thats about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Derived facts\n",
    "There is a special type of fact called a **derived fact**. These are facts that are derived from other facts. For example, a profit measure can be derived from the difference between revenue and cost. Derived facts can be physically stored in the fact table or calculated on the fly. Calculating it on the fly makes it prone to user errors, as well as it impacts performance. We need to analyze the physical cost of storing the derived fact vs the cost of calculating it on the fly and getting it wrong. Another thing to keep in mind is how often the rules for calculating the derived fact change. If it changes often, it might be better to calculate it on the fly. Views can be used as a middle ground, where the derived fact is calculated on the fly but the view is stored in the database. The view isn't maintained by the users, however the analyst must ensure that all users use the view and not the underlying table.\n"

    "In DuckDB, when were adding a [generated column](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/statements/create_table#generated-columns) (which we're using to implement derived facts) - we can choose wether to store it virtually or phyisically unsing the `STORED` keyword. Virtually stored values are calculated every time the data is read. Physically stored values are calculated when the data is written, and stored in the table. By default, generated columns are virtual values, and the type can also be infered by DuckDB. Also, generated columns can't be used with the `INSERT` statement."

We can calculate this value in multiple steps of our pipeline. It could be generated by the source system, and we could assume that it's correct. We could also calculate it in the ETL process, or in a view built on top of the table loaded with the ETL process. In this case, we will calculate it in LOAD step of our ETL process by making it a column that is calculated when data is inserted into the table."

    "Another example of a non-additive fact is the `regular_unit_price` and `net_unit_price` measures. Summing up unit prices across different dimensions generally doesn't make sense. It generates a number, however it's not a useful number. This number can be calculated quite easily, but in a business sense, it has little meaning. It gives us the for the sum of all the products sold by store, considering only 1 product per transaction (So even if some bought 2 of an item, it's only counted twice)."

This metric could be use to build a report that shows. This give us a absolute value for the ammount of money that came into a store. We could improve this even more by using the `extended_gross_profit_dollars` measure, which gives us the absolute value of the profit generated by a store. This is a useful metric since it gives us the actual value of the profit generated by a store, and we could use to see which stores are making the most money - even if they're selling less items."
