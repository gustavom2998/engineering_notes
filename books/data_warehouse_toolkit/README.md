# The Data Warehouse Toolkit

Personal notes based of the book [The Data Warehouse Toolkit: The Definitive Guide to Dimensional Modeling](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Warehouse-Toolkit-Definitive-Dimensional/dp/1118530802) by Ralph Kimball and Margy Ross. The notes are based of the 3rd edition of the book. In the near future, I'll try to add some SQL samples to the notes.

## Personal Notes

I started reading this book in November 2021. The context for getting into this book was that I was half way into attempting to structure raw data from our data lake and my manager mentioned it might be a good read. He was right, the book gave me a recipe for doing the stuff I had been doing for the last couple of months without understanding what I was doing or why I was doing it.

We ended up not implementing a dimensional model, we only got up to creating a 3NF Model for the ETL system and then had to settle for a one-big table solution. I managed to get a good grasp of needing to collect and transform data from multiple sources, needing to create metadata and cosistent labels - and had first hand experience with the problems that came with it.
